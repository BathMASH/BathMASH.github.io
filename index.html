<h1>MASH Crowdsourced Bilingual Mathematics Dictionaries</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is an ongoing project, started in summer 2014, with the aim of providing bilingual mathematics dictionaries which translate (without definition) mathematical terms which may be assumed knowledge in higher education in England.</p> 

<h2>Can I use the resource yet?</h2>
<p>
Below you can view and download the content so far produced but right now we need proofreaders and translators for all languages except for Welsh!</p>
</p>

<h2>Resources for all students</h2>
<p>As part of the project a list of mathematical terminology in common use in the UK but not itself in English was also collated. This will be useful for all students.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./common/index.html">General vocabulary</a></li>
<li><a href="./common/general-math-dic.docx">General vocabulary (Word)</a></li>
<li><a href="./common/general-math-dic.odt">General vocabulary (ODT)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Help us add to this resource</h2>

<h3>Can you be a proofreader?</h3>
<p>
Are you bilingual? Were you taught mathematics to age 18 in a language other than English? Have you completed at least 2 years of a mathematics or statistics degree taught in English or are now teaching mathematics in English? If you can answer yes to all these questions please <a href="./forms/proofreader.html">fill in our form to request to be a proofreader</a>. 
</p> 

<h3>Can you be a translator?</h3>
<p>
If you are bilingual and have been taught mathematics in both languages at some point then you can volunteer as a translator! You can translate as little as a single word, it all helps and <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/sigma-lang/invite">you can get started straight away.</a> All your translations will be checked by a proofreader once one has been found for the language in question. Only proofread translations will be published.
</p>

<h3>Get in touch with suggestions!</h3>
<p>
Please use our project e-mail address to get in touch about this work: <a href="mailto:mash-lang@bath.ac.uk">mash-lang@bath.ac.uk</a>. The basic set of terms was selected for translation by students bilingual in English and Welsh. Their aim was to collate the mathematical terms which may be assumed knowledge in higher education. We might have missed some! The set of languages below was selected, rather arbitrarily, based on the percentage of speakers in the EU population. We can add terms and 'rarer' languages if we hear from you. Please get in touch if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are studying in the UK but the language you were taught mathematics in is not in the below list.</li>
<li>You could be a proofreader for a language which is not in the below list.</li>
<li>You have suggestions for mathematical terms which should be translated.</li>
</ul>
